                    <p><span>B</span>ack in 2010, I saw a hardcore show at this place called Secret Art Space. It was located in the little town of Bethlehem (Pennsylvania, USA) and featured the following bands: Hero Destroyed, Iron Thrones, Mose Giganticus and Fight Amp(utation). It was quite a line-up as all of the bands killed the tiny garage with intensity and heat. But I do remember especially having the feels for Fight Amp because they were not only from my hometown Philadelphia, they encompassed annihilating mix of grunge and punk that never ceases to amaze my tiny ears.</p>

                    <p>So, it was a nice surprise to hear of the return of these noise rockers with their new album Constantly Off released just last week. The entire album is crushingly short and, uh… bitter. The ride is almost too short even. But the track that stood out the most to me is ‘I Perceive Reptoids’, making it my Song of the Day. It is absolutely the sludgiest track on the record and mocks the “blank planet” culture of our day and age as most of us are subconsciously programmed by the system. Why can’t we break away from our TVs (or YouTube) and create admirable life of our own?! Anyways. I’m not whether it’s the doom and gloom of the opening bass or the screeching of the distorted guitars that effectively drains my heart while listening to this track. But I’ll tell you one thing, I rage to all 2 minutes and 27 seconds of it.</p>

                    <p>Purchase Constantly Off here and see Fight Amp on their upcoming tour with KEN Mode.</p>
