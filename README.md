## My first static website from scratch!

Hi, my name is Ebonie Butler and I'm a full stack developer who specializes in WordPress and Reast.js. This is the first website I've ever created from scratch. I used HTML, CSS, Javascript (jQuery), Bootstrap Framework, Font Awesome and Flickity CSS to create this website.
