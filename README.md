Hi, my name is Ebonie Butler and I'm a web developer. This is the second prototype of my first website from scratch. I used HTML, CSS, Javascript (jQuery), Bootstrap Framework, Font Awesome and Flickity CSS to create this website. This website is being used as a blueprint for my first custom wordpress theme.
